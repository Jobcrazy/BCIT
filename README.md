## About

My name is Hang Liu. I was a student at Computer Systems Technology Program at British Columbia Institute of Technology.

This repository was for my quiz, assignment, and exams. I think it will help you through the difficult period of study at BCIT.

However, I majored in Information System option. As a result, I do not have code for other options from term 3 to term 4.
